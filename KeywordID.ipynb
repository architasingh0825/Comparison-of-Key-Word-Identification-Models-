       "\" hello my name is dr. Susan Robbins onthe class's comparative human behaviorTheory say hello to the future viewingaudience class okay today we're gonnacontinue on the lectures I'm going to betalking about Sigmund Freud I have mylittle fried bobble head here and I wantto thank my friend Eddie Caron Lorenzoin New York who gave me this littleFreud bobblehead I'm sure he's gonna bewatching me on YouTube to listen forthis thank you we're gonna be talkingabout Freudian based theory andordinarily years ago let me start withthis years ago as Freudian theory was onthe wane on the win why was it on theway and it had fallen out of favoressentially throughout we've got to keepthis in historical perspective and Iknow I talked about this probably thevery first lecture that very early onsocial workers not just psychiatristsand not just psychologists but veryearly on social workers adopted Freudiantheory and from Freudian theory to neoFreudian theory and that was essentiallythe primary theory base that accountedfor most human behavior for tea and Andyof Freudian theory through most of the50s 60s and even up to the 70s it reallywas until the late seventies and earlyeighties the Social Work quote/unquotediscovered Systems Theory so theFreudian paradigm has been around for avery long time it's an enduring paradigmand as we started to move away fromstrictly for tea in theory and then withmore towards ericksonian ego basedTheory Freud and Freud's thinking prettymuch went by the wayside in social workhowever as we're gonna see next weekwhen we talk about Erikson Erickson'stheory is also inculcated with Freudianthought and as you'll find in yourreadings that we have people who wroteafter Freud being either reformulate inother words they started with the basicpremises that he did and then Reifformulated his theory or people whototally revised revisionists who revisedhis very entirely so in order tounderstand the revisionists of thereformulate errs it's important tounderstand the basis of what he wassaying now when I said I thought theFreud was dead I mean yes he wasphysically dead obviously butthought that that 14 thought had all butdied out in social work and then roughlyin the 1980s early 90s Freudian Theoryreared its head again and we're gonna betalking about that and talking about thecontroversy but before we get to thecontroversy we're gonna talk about todaythe basis of Freudian theory what was hereally really saying and most of us knowthe basic concept the ear the ego thesuper-ego we know his developmentalstages but very few people have goneback and read the original or firstinterpretations of Freud most peoplewhen they read Freud they do not go backto the interpret why do I sayinterpretations translations because hedidn't read in English so most peoplewho are reading about fraud in theirpsychology textbooks read what I'm gonnacall digestible versions of Freud andit's not necessarily what Freud wasactually saying so I think it'simportant to understand the logic ofthis here of his theory for us tounderstand how all these reformulateerrs and revisionists came to what theythink came to write about what theythought so too the first PowerPointwe're gonna be talking about dr. SigmundFreud okay back over to me when we talkabout Freudian theory it's important toalways well put this in historicalcontext every theory that we look atwe've got to look at not only the theorybut we've got to take a look somewhat atthe life of the person writing thetheory because if you remember what Isaid during the first class theories arean extension of several things they'rean extension of the theorists him orherself it's also an extension of thehistorical time period in which theylived again theories are time specificsocial science theoriesthat's because theorists live in certainkinds of environments political socialeconomic environments that play a veryrodgero role in their thinking and isthere thinking that brings us thetheories that make sense job okay soagain theories are part and parcel ofthe theorist him or herself as well asbeing bound to the particular historicaltimeframeand what that goes all of thesocio-political environments that ispresent at the time that the person iswriting so Freud he started off as aneurologist started off as a neurologistnot a psychiatrist not a psychoanalystand he was in private medical practicein Vienna and what steered him to lookat his how people functioned was that hewas seeing people would come to him withneurological symptoms and yet he couldnot find a physical basis for theirillness and people who would come to himwith with neurological symptoms such asparalysis and yet he would look at themphysically as a neurologist and couldnot find a basis for the paralysisanother example they would come withblurred vision couldn't finecould not simply could not find aphysical basis for it so it is inquiryhe was trying to figure out what causesthese clearly physical symptoms that donot have a physiological basis which isan important question for a neurologistto be asking right and he started bylearning about a man named ginger Co atthe time who was working with hypnosiswhat would happen is that he would putthese people typically women but notalways typically women under hypnoticspell and the symptoms paralysis theblurred vision would simply disappearand in fact some of them even after theywoke up from the hypnotic trance haslost the symptoms entirely so that ledfor to think ah it's not in their bodyit's in thereeverybody mind right so what Freud Judashe studied hypnosis he went to Paris andin 1885 and 1886 he studied hip hypnosisnow what he was asking about withsimilarities between his cases and thepatients that he was seeing and thecases that he saw Jean chocomiraculously quote-unquote sure at leastalleviate temporary symptoms and whatFreud did is that he divides hispsychoanalytic theory specifically hewas trying to explain the mind-bodyrelationship this all makes sense nowtrying to explain the mind by therelationship in other words how couldthe mind creates symptoms that wereclearly physical in nature or appear tobe but yet the symptoms weren't comingfrom any kind of illness they weren'tcoming from any kind of physical andthis medical illness they weren't comingfrom any kind of injury they were comingfrom the mind so that's a starting pointand that will also help us understandwhy he believes so thoroughly inhypnosisvery early in his theory back to thePowerPoint Freud proposed that therewere three levels of consciousnessremember this is a theory of mind so nowhe's no longer looking at the body andhe's talking about what are the levelsof consciousness and how do they affectphysiological functioning let's startwith the unconscious the unconscious isthat region of the mind that holdsthoughts and memories that we simplycannot access unconscious means that itis not in our conscious awareness andwill always stay not in our consciousawareness again we cannot access and wealso cannot bring it into our consciousawareness now let's take a look at thisanalytically is there such a thingcalled the unconscious do we know thatthere are unconscious processes folksyes or no where do we see them how do wesee them dreams okay certainly live ordream when we're dreaming we are notawake and in fact dreaming became a verypart analyzing zero became a verysignificant part for its theory soclearly we know that we have someunconscious processes that occur withoutour awareness and where do they come outin our dreams and if we happen to be inthe right REM state when we wake up wemight or might not remember those dreamsor parts of those dreams however andhere's the important part of Freud'stheory he said that even though wecannot access these thoughts theseemotions these feelings these memoriesthey still affect our consciousfunctioninglet me repeat that even though thesethoughts these memories these feelingsthat are in our unconscious but wecannot access during our waking momentsthey are there but they not only affectus unconsciously but here's the leapthat they affect that they affect ourconscious being as well but we areunaware of them they affect our behaviorwe're unaware of them they affect ourbehavior and therefore in Freud's theoryhe said that much of what we do ashumans is based on what he calledunconscious motivation by the wayunconsciousness was not was not a newidea other philosophers have proposedthis long ahead of Freud and what thedifferences of the Freud elaborated onit and he made it take a very centralrole in our functioning you allunderstand this again other people havetalked about the unconscious theunconscious was not a new concept whatwas new in Freud's theory is that theunconscious plays a central role in theway we function on a day-to-day basisthe next level of consciousness that hetalked about kind of enjoy your diagramof this is what he called the preconscious the preconscious holds theideas and the thoughts and the memoriesthat we are not currently thinking sothese are thoughts ideas memoriesfeelings that we are not conscious of atthe moment but we can bring it intoconsciousness in contrast to the deepdeep dark unconscious where we cannotbring it into consciousness just bywilling and so now following that andI'm going to draw what this looks likeclearly the conscious part of theconscious part of the mind is the awarepart of the mindbe aware part of the mind okay so overto the tablet please this is my not soaccurate and probably very poorly drawndrawing of this roughlylet's try black or blueokay what are you wrong somethingobviouslyso if we start off with something calledthe deep unconscious and we know attacha structure to it and you got tounderstand that all of these aretheoretical and philosophical conceptsthere is no structure in the brain thatwe can point to that we call theunconscious that's really clear aboutthat so as part of our functioning wehave a deep unconscious and these arethe thoughts the feelings the memoriesthat we simply cannot access I want totalk about how that grows throughout thelifetime any questions about the deepunconscious okay back to the power pointvery important to Freud's theory is therole of instincts the role of instinctsthese according to Freud were inbornfactors that give force and givedirection to all of our psychologicalactivity so Freudian theory is based onwhat we call basic instincts not themovie but the method theory and inFreud's formulation there are two basicinstincts that drive our psychologicalfunctioning and those are essentiallythe life instinct which he attributed tobe libido or sex and later in hiswritings he came across something calledit came to discover something called thedeath instinct which he saw asaggression so let's take a look at thislogically folks what he's saying then isthat what steering us is sex excessivesex aggression aggression aggressionthat these things are innate they arethere when infants are born sex andaggression are those are the things thatreally steer our psychologicaldevelopmentso let me stop for a moment what do youthink about that what are your thoughtsabout that does it make sense yes noyou're the reader you're saying no whynot you have to use the mic mmm I don'tthink it's just that simpleokay so you think that it's a little bitmore complex than that a little morecomplex than thatwhy would people find this appealingfolks let's look at this realisticallythe 14 paradigm Freudian modeledaffordance for the etherion 40 andthought is so much a part of our cultureso much a part of our culture it came tobe so incredibly accepted by people inmainstream psychiatry people inmainstream psychology what would be soappealing about thatyeah the agenda I think it's because ittakes a more pessimistic view of humannature and kind of gives people anexcuse that were expected to satisfy ourbiological drives okay you saypessimistic what do you see aboutpessimistic about it well it's it paintshuman nature is very one-dimensional andthere's that biological component thatyes we have to procreate and reproduceand not let ourselves get killed butthere's more to us than that okay geniusidea hood up you have to use the miclike Mike like I also know that it wasVictorian times I repressed this game adifferent view we could not we didn'thave to be so repressed we could wecould talk about sex sake we could talkabout sex you got to be again you got toput it in cultural context coming out ofthe Victorian area sex was somethingthat people didn't talk about we stilldon't but well we're we are consumedwith ideas about sex but we shall talkabout it right but people then didn'ttalk about it at all and therefore theidea that people could be sexual beingswas somewhat enlightening particularlyto the more liberal thinkers of the dayso it had it had very instant appeal anda caught on first in Europe and thencertainly over here andbecame mainstream in what we do insocial work okay back to the PowerPointokay along with these basic instincts heproposed that we have a basicpersonality structure basic personalitystructure okaygoing through my notes real quicklylet's talk about the ED first let'sstart with this it's a theoreticalstructure it's not a real physicalstructure everybody clear about that sowhen I say show me your it can you dothat no you can't because it doesn'tagain none of this theory corresponds toanything specific in the brain eventhough currently there are some peopleduring their illogical research who aretrying to tire to that but Freud eventhough he was a neurologist he was nottalking about any neurologicalstructures of the brain rather he'stalking about something called the mindwhich is a theoretical construct if Iask you where is your mind where is itwhere do all of us point to immediatelyour brain right other cultures when yousay where is your mind they'll point tothe heart they were point to other partsof the body but in Western culture weassociate the mind with the brainphysiological functioning and yet thereis no structure in the brain called themindlet me be clear about it's a theoreticalstructure get back to Viad PowerPointfor a minute very importantly the edgecorresponds to the unconscious so the itis a totally unconscious part of theself and what a via comprised of thosebasic drives which are what everybodyusing like sex sex sex sex andaggression basic drives on what hecalled instinctual energies sex andaggressionokay so let's talk about the EDD for asecond back to me in Freudian theory theunconscious level the it containseverything that we bring into this worldat birth and therefore the Beadnellenergy libidinal energy remember sex isone of the driving forces assumes theform of needs people have theseinstinctual urges these sexualaggressive and sexual urges coming fromthe it'd and these have to be fulfilledin one way or another these needs haveto be fulfilled and therefore Freudianthought when you release libido yourelease that sexual energy it isexperienced as in Freud's terminologypleasure well think about this here isthis infant with all of these theBeadnell instincts that have to beexpressed and once they are expressed inone way or another the release of all ofthis tension of pressure and the edgegives the personal pleasure that makessense not doesn't make sense from thereal world does it make sense in termsof theory yes okay conversely when youblock the ability to release will be analleged energy what does it experienceas the sensation frustration of painpleasure and pain so let's think aboutan infant and and essentially these areall theories about what is going on inthe infant's mind therefore what Freudsaid is that the it operates onsomething called the pleasure principleand what is the pleasure principle giveme give me give me give me pleasure andwhat do I want to avoid no pain keep thepain awayaccording to Freud the newborn isprimarily it'd primarily it'd andtherefore what the newborn is trying todo is satisfy these libido urges andsatisfy the needs according to Freud thenewborns awareness of the external worldwas very very fuzzy very very fuzzymostly what's tearing infants is give mepleasure give me pleasure give mepleasure write very importantly inFreudian theory the infant cannotdistinguish self from other and thisbecomes a real cornerstone of not onlyfor daeun theory but all other varietiesof the Audion theory ok because theinfant can't distinguish the self fromthe other the infant is only aware oftwo things and this in this formulationpleasure and pain ok as the infant growsand starts to experience more of theexternal world awareness begins todevelop awareness begins to developessentially his what is the Freud'smodel said and this is in some of hislater writings what he was sayingessentially is that we are born withthese in schedule urges and the twoindividual urges are painted are sex andaggression and if that is our normalstate of being that is our normal stateof being because that's what we are bornwith then it takes society a lot of workto socialize those instincts out of usdoes that make sense again it's a normalstate of the human infant is sex andaggression and that's how they get theirneeds met then it takes a lot ofsocietal intervention and socializationto socialize those instincts intosomething that makes us a social beingso influenced formulation there wasalways this tension between society thathad rules and norms for conformity andthis needy is that wanted to get us ineach matter do not help you a little bitto understand the basic room which iscomingokay part of what goes on with theinfant according to Freud is somethingcalled primary process I don't have aPowerPoint for this you just listen towhat it is it's the earliest level ofawareness results in what he called aprimary process this is real critical tohis theory primary process is theinstance act of creating in its memorythe image of an object that's going togive it pleasure let me repeat that oneof the primary things that goes on ininfancy according to Freud in primaryprocess is that because the baby isalways seeking pleasure pleasurepleasure yes and what the infant must dois create in its memory the image ofsome external object that's going togive it pleasure because it cannot getpleasure on its own well think aboutthis the child needs to eat thechildhood the infant has no access tofood and therefore whatever object givesa pleasure it's going to create memoriesoften that make sense so let's say thechild is hungry what happens whenchildren get an infant's get hungry whatdo they do they crywhat do mothers do in response to thechildren crying they see them eitherbreastfeed them certainly in for timewith breast feeding or now we give themformula okay on 14 theory once the childhas been fed the tension of hunger isgone and the child experiences what okayyou got it what he says is that therepeated cycles repeated cycles of theinfant's having his or her needs met andgetting pleasure what the infants startto do is to store images in the mindabout how they can get satisfaction sonow at this point in Freud's theory theinfant can now imagine those things thatare going to bring pleasure and in thiscase in the very early stages what is ithusband has it been historicallymother's breast rightokay very importantly primary processbecause all it driven is irrational it'schaoticit doesn't distinguish betweenreasonable demands and unreviewedunreasonable demands all that theinfant's is saying to himself or herselfis gimme-gimme-gimmeright whether or not Mommy is availableat that moment is irrelevant because thechild still has these interesting twourges so it's irrational because thechild is experiencing these urges andyet the environment at that time mightnot be able to meet these urges veryimportantly the primary urge of the edgethe primary concern is to gainsatisfaction regardless of whether ornot the method of satisfaction ispractical or even available in theenvironment again let's think about theit urges give me give me give me give meMom might not be there but yet the urgesare still there okay so what's thepersonality needs next think about thisbecause this is the first part ofpersonality this isn't a saying gimmegimme gimme I want pleasureI don't want pain and if those impulsesaren't satisfied what does it maybeexperience hey hey everybody come on yougot to keep me awake today okay so thenext thing that has to develop in thepersonality structure is a componentthat recognizes the nature of theenvironment because so far it's justprimary it urgesokay back over to the PowerPoint so thenext structure that emerges is thesecond component of what he called apsychic apparatus is the ego again it'sa theoretical structure if I say show meyour ego can you tell me where it is nobecause there isn't a physical thing tocorresponds to ego this is the next partof personality that includes both theconscious and the preconscious and itdevelops out of the it I'm going to drawthis for you so you can see this it'snot a separate structure it actuallydevelops out of the ID's merges itsurges that's hard to say as a responseto the environment and it helps childrendistinguish self from other becauseearly on according to Freud the world isvery fuzzy to infants and they cannottell the difference between them andtheir mother's breastokay back over to meunlike the it was worse on whichprinciple being worked on whichprinciple everybody slash pleasureprinciple gimme-gimme-gimme right giveme pleasure keep me out of painthe ego on the other hand works on whathe called the reality principle what thereality principle does is that itreorganizes the conditions and demandsof the real recognizes the conditionsand the met demands of the real world sohere's this is that's not able to dothis but here's the next part ofpersonality structure that says ok Bob'snot here I'm gonna have to wait andessentially what the it ends up doing isplaying the role of the negotiator inbetween the reality of the environmentand the ID's demands which may beunreasonable for the moment the ego hasto turn this primary process imagesthose images of sodor in the brand intoreality and therefore thisproblem-solving act of the ego is whathe called the secondary process thereality principle is tied to thesecondary process it's the way that thechild solves the problem so there's anet that there's that unsocialized it'ssaying feed me feed me feed me hungerHunger hunger until the ego develops thechild is going to be frustrated withyour pain once we have a developing egothe ego might say ok mom's out hereyou're gonna have to wait you're gonnahave to wait no following that sothere's no part of personality structurethat helps mediate the real environmentwith these it urgesin the secondary process according toFreud the individuals develop skills andperceiving and remembering and analyzingand taking and taking direct actionagain the secondary process is unlikethe primary process which is chaoticright this is a very organized processin which the child begins to perceiveremember analyze and start to takeaction okay so let's stop for a minuteand take a look at this in addition towhat's going on supposedly interestpsychically inside the mind what else inreality is going on with infants of thestage biologicallywell what happens to infantsbiologically do they stay little tinyinfants grow they grow so what'shappening we're having maturation of allof the bodily all of the perceptualorgans the eyes the ears the nose rightyou know infants have very blurry visionwhen they're first born as the eyesmature they begin to see more clearlyhearing changes the sense of toucheverything changes as as the childbegins to grow so essentially what'shappening with the ego is that it growsfrom the id's needs from the maturingbodily organs and very importantly theit's increasing awareness of the worldthe is increasing awareness of the worldnow Freud did not time is taught thespecific brain processes becauseremember he was talking about thistheoretical structure of the mind butone of the things that we know now knowfrom cognitive science is that asinfants grow and develop neurologicallywhat's taking place in the brain is thatnew neurological connections areconstantly being made tremendous growthspurts which is why we see all of asudden the children physiologically andbiologically maturing being able to docognitive things differently atdifferent stages of development it'sdifficult because of the neurologicalconnections that are constantlyconstantly growing in the brain anyquestions about that ok let's go back tothe tablet now for a minutemove this over here and I'm gonna drawwhat-what the development of the egodidn't the super-ego look like it inthis theory so roughly this is a childat one month okay and this is the it'dso at one month atados primarily it'dprimarily primary process as a childstarts to grow and develop what we thensee and you remember what we said aboutthe ears the it conscious or unconsciouseverybody there is no conscious elementof the age the it is totally unconsciousyou're following us so this is what wecall the deep unconscious Floydsunconscious and what's going on therewhat's going on in the unconscious andeverybody instincts for pleasure avoidpain to give me pleasure right okay asthe child growshere we have the beginning of the thisis hard to do over here try this againI'll make this a little bit bigger wehave the beginning of an ego then you'llread that that's his egoso this is roughly in fourthsformulation what the it and the ego looklike at one month so what can we saythat the child is primarily whateverybody primarily in just a verybeginning developing there you go okaysome of them see if I can scroll downhere to the next page this is always achallenge to me there we gowe're gonna take a look now at a childat roughly 3 years I really want you tosee the difference in the way thesestructures developed say here that wasone month here we have the child ofthree years at three years we have moreof an ego development but we still donot have the next structure so here wehave I'm going to introduce you anotherconcept as well again this is a verybadly drawn representation of this herewe have the edge here we now have a muchbigger ego you're following upnow there's something else that goes onand there's something called repressionsanybody know what happens when werepress thingsoh come on folks the concept back overto me the concept of repression is somuch a part of our society of all theFreudian terminology and there's much ofit that gets into our our everydaylanguage is a repression part of thatwhat happens when people were pressingsany ideas might become depressedthey might show their behavior asrepression as depression but somethingmore basic happens whatever anybody hasanybody read the champion okay denial wedon't accept we keep it in theunconscious who doesn't come out to ouroffice level repression according toFreud with an unconscious process let'sgo back to his basic theory here is theit seeking pleasure pleasure pleasurebefore the ego develops what happenspleasure isn't always available and thebaby experience was that as traumatic aspain so what does the baby do with thispain the infants repress memories ofthings that are uncomfortable and whatdoes that mean that they take thisnegative events and push it down intothe deep unconscious so that they don'thave to deal with it on a consciouslevel you following this repression is avery very big part of this theorybecause what he is saying essentially islet's go back to the basics the it iswhat pleasure pleasure pleasure is thepleasure always there so how does thechild handle this according to Freudthere's this mechanism by which theinfant then represses all of the unmetneeds of things that are too traumatictoo uncomfortable so therefore go backto the drawn by the time the child isthree years old we have lots ofrepressionsand all of this takes place where in theunconscious head you're following up sotherefore do you see how the ego growthout of the it'd it's not a separatestructure I know that this sounds likesilly stuff why do we need to know thisbecause those who reformulated Freud andgot into a lot of trouble doing sobecause Freud then became their enemyrather than their friend in some casesdecided that this model was not correctand it's all about these theoreticalstructures that don't really exist inthe real world the things that peoplestrongly believed him so again do youunderstand why fraud says that the egogrows out of the edge because it's inresponse to the id's needs that are notbeing met you're following that okay andtherefore before our child has a goodand healthy ego because this child isstill growing and the ego growsaccording to Freud as the child getsolder so if you start with a veryimmature ego that cannot that can nowdeal with with the conflictual demandsof the it and the reality of societywhat happens is the child then repressesthose memories does that make sense interms of the theory not in terms of reallife yes okay so here we're and here'swhat we have the ego and we have thethought process I'm sorry consciousthought processes that take place inwith the awareness of the ego or theirthought processes let's turn over to menow are their thought processes takingplace in in the unconscious or not yesbut they're not conscious you'refollowing this the the infant still hasdrives and needs they are now repressedso those thoughts that are repressed anykind of frustrations are repressed intothe edge so it's not a conscious thoughtprocess but there are still thoughtsgoing on there that we're not aware ofinstincts going on there as well you'refollowing this is this is this helpingyou understand Freudian thought a littlebit better okayhe next dropped her back from thepowerpoints the next structure todevelop is what he called the super egothe super-ego has essentially twocomponents the super-ego the part wecall conscience what what is itsfunction it punishes the child withfeelings of guilt or shame wheninternalized values are not followed soessentially the super-ego is thesocialization it's the way in which thechild incorporates all the norms notonly of mom and dad but the norms ofsociety and again this is an this is aprocess that goes on internally in themind and children who have a verywell-developed super-ego when they dosomething wrong what do they feel shameand guilt on the other hand here's theflipside of this the super-ego alsorewards the child with pride and selfpraise when those internalized valuesare followed which he called the egoidealso let's analyze this for a second thisis really important back over to meagainessentially what Ford was saying is thatas we get older roughly five or sixyears old up until age five or six weare primarily idiot in what grows out ofthat we get a stronger and stronger egomore ego as we as we grow and have moreexperience with the world at this pointthe ego is playing a very large role inmediating reality and the its needshowever there's a third component thatis necessary and that is thesocialization the ability of the childnot to be functioning only onnegotiating reality in the his knees butthe ability of the child to internalizethe core values of his or her Society ofhis or her family and this develops witha structure that he called the super-egowe're gonna talk in great detail aboutthe super-egoI'm gonna draw it for you first thoughso back to the tablet if I can get thisto move well the viewing audience is notseeing is that I'm struggling with thestylus because I'm left-handed and thisis the right hand all tablets areright-handed okay we're gonna see a verydifferent picture now I merge and thenI'm going to talk about the processesthat Freud said said took place todevelop the super-ego let me stop withany questions any questions first I'mbeing as clear as mud no questions atall if I go on cuz it gets reallycomplex from here it gets really complexfrom here okay back to the tablet okayso by aids 12 children start to developa super-ego in Freud's theory roughly atage five or six and this is age 12 thisis what this would look likeoh by the way anytime you see thislittle thing on top this isconsciousness even in adults that wouldrepresent in other words what I'm sayingis that the majority the majority of ourlives are spent with unconsciousprocessesso that's conscious aspect of self sowhat do we have here now we have the earthat we started with right I'm drawingthese lines just to differentiate thetwo here we have the ego look at how bigit's gotten yeshere we have now by age 12 to the Churchof the child have many more repressionsabsolutely because the charges are asexperience adverse things in theenvironment things that that the auntsees is adverse so what do we have herenow we have significantly morerepressionsbut now we have a new structure on adifferent color here called thesuper-ego do you see how this super-egois not part of the conscious processbecause where's consciousnessconsciousness is right here rightthis is consciousness right here so thesuper-egoin essence is still part of theunconscious process but it crosses theit and the ego no following us so thisis the super-ego I'm just gonna putessay for super-egoand what do we have in the consciouspart of the self we have all the valueswe have the rules because what consciousof those are we by age six by age twelvelet's think about that for a secondfolks okay away from playfulness andover to me have any let me give you areal concrete example have any of youever tried playing a board game with athree or four year old yes what happensuse your mics and tell me what happensyeah take care they cheat and theychange the rules all the time okay theyby our standards they quote unquotecheats they change the rules becausethey have not internalized rules tofollow you say this is the way thepieces jump on the board and they don'tcare they'll just jump to pieces any waythey please and that's because they donot have a super-ego to constrain themyou'll following this what happens howmany of you have played board games withchildren who are six or older roughly atage six what kind of change do you seeanybody they're very focused on beingfair or things being fairmore so than fair anybody else have aclue okay what else more importantchange a rule is a rule is a rule andyou cannot break the rules and used totell and say oh but the rules no they'renot but what I'm trying to get at isthat in this sense board really wasright roughly at age five or six andagain he was basing this on observationof children more so observation ofclients roughly what does happen tochildren roughly at age five or six thathe called the super-ego you were gonnafind other theorists calling itsomething else what he's saying is thatfinally the children are able tointernalize the rules internalize thenorms internalize the expectations ofsociety so that whereby as you carepointed out a child cheats they don'tknow it's cheating they're just makingup their own rules because they have notyet internalized what is right what iswrong by age five or six AF so totallyinternalize it that you cannot steerfrom the rules in a board game becausethe child says we have to follow therules there's no flexibility now that'schangehopefully as children get older by agefive or six without showing us is thatthey really have internalized the rightsand the wrongs and what are the twoprocesses of the super-ego that wetalked about everybody socializationprocess a little on the ego ideal andand conscious children gain a sense ofconscience children gain a sense ofconscience and therefore they have tofollow what is right to avoid feelingbad you're following that and was Freudright about the age in which thishappens absolutely he was dead on againother people have talked about the samething and we'll talk about othertheorists and simply called it somethingelse and the difference is that othertheorists do not say that that theconscience developed out of a necessityto the is greedy urges again that's whatFreud brings uniquely to this anyquestions so farokay back to this for one second to thetablet so we can see from this and againyou're gonna laugh at how important thisbecomes that Freud said that the egogrows out of the edge and the super egodevelops in response to both the eagleand the edge so it's still anunconscious process what the consciouspart of the e of the super-ego is uphere where we can see the childrenunderstand the rules that theyunderstand the norms you're followingthat okayback over to me from it very importantlypart of for experience that he said thechildren are born a moral not immoralbut a moral in other words childrensimply do not know good from bad they'renot born tabula rasa because they areborn with what this did with all of theurgent needs with all of the instinctsright but children are not born badthey're not born good they are bornamoral according to Freud in earlystages morality for children is simplygetting pleasure and avoiding punishmentvery importantly a young child infantsyoung children before the age of six donot feel bad if they don't follow therules as we can see from board gamesthey think cheating is fine andtypically what happens with with parentsthey're the ones who manipulate therewards and punishments for the childrenright very importantly in Freud's theoryabout the super-ego is that even thoughchildren are not born morrow they havethe capacity to internalize moral valuesagain the capacity to internalize moralvalues and feel good when they'refollowing them and feel bad when they'renotso in Freud's theory just as the egodevelops out of the ED the super-egodeveloped out of the ego no followingthat yes any questions about thatnow you saw as I drew it the part of itis unconsciouspart of our super-ego is unconscious andpart of it is conscious questionseverybody understand that much yeah whatwhy is it the upside of the needs of theego because the ego is already mediatingthe instinctual and kind of keeping thatso why would we okay if the ego had todo that all the time it would have avery very tough job and therefore for aperson once the ego is developed we havenot internalized the rules of society soif we didn't have this new structurecalled the super ego the ego would haveto work overtime negotiating realitywith the is urges all the time andtherefore again part of this is based onobservations of people that people donot stay it processes they do not staywith having an ego having to mediatethat instead something called thesuper-ego helps us manage our needs andtherefore punishes us when we're notfollowing what's expected and makes usfeel good when we are it's just one morestage of development any other questionsnone on being that clear I just lovethat okay now we're going to turn to thestage is the actual stages ofdevelopment we already talked about thisrepression it's an unconscious egodefense it's an unconscious ego defenseand what happens when people will pressthings and again there's a significantpart of Freud's theory and a verysignificant part of the controversy thatfollowed Freud unpleasant experiencesare pushed down into the deepunconscious very importantly this is nota conscious process it's not like I hada trauma and I'm aware of it and I don'twant to think about it and I trysomething consciously to get rid of itin this formulation for its formulationthe minute that the edge is experienceis having difficulty because this needsabout not being met and there's anunpleasant experience of snorting it'sthe ability to get pleasure what happensis that unconsciously we repress or pushthese experiences down into our deepunconscious that's a really importantpart of this theory because what Freudsaid is that most pathology in adultlife the result is the result of whatrepressions repressionsand therefore we have a lot of pathologythat come out of these repressions thatwe're simply not aware of and yetaccording to Freud a affect our behavioras adults they affect our behavior inthe here and now even though we are notconsciously aware of them and thereforeone of the aims of Freudian basedtherapy is to get all of these repressedideas out in the open where we can thendeal with them and hopefully we willchange our behavior now whether or notthat happens is another issue entirelyokay let's take a look at Freud stagesof development does everybody understandthe underlying psychic mechanisms beforewe go into the actual stages okay whatI've described to you so far are theactual psychic mechanisms orpsychological mechanisms again these arenot structures that are tied to thebrain development but rather thistheoretical concept of what that whatgoes on in the quote-unquote mindokay according to Freud we're gonna gothrough the each stage we let's startwith your old stage oral stage back overto me though very importantly Freudbelieved that's the development of thepsyche or personality that's what equalpersonality was influenced by the way inwhich children expend libido energy notmaking sense you know the way in whichthey expend the energy and the mostsignificant experiences that the childhas in expending that energy as aninfant are related to the body sensitiveor what he called the erogenous zonesremember why would he be looking aterogenous zones cuz he's dealing withsex as being one of the primaryinstincts everybody following that okayand in his theory those erogenous zoneschange those erogenous zones change overthe course of the child's developmentand what's going on they're expendinglabeed '''l energy folks this is this ishard to understand because it's all ofthis unconscious processes and thingslike libido energy that's very hard todefine what it is and that's certainlyone of the problems with Freudian theoryis that you can't prove it so when wetalk about expanding the beatle energyat different parts of the body we startfirst with the mouth than the anus andthe genitals and that that's where I wastheory runs essentially what for thething is that at different stages thechild experiences is libidinal pleasurein in a very sensuous way because he'stalking about sexual energy and not onlyis the child expending libidinal energyon different erogenous zones here's thekey to the theory is that the childrelationships with other people areheavily influenced by what the way theypay attention to or don't pay attentionto the child's attention at that zone atthat time so again it's not just what'sgoing on in the mind of the child butalso the way in which relationships areforged and what happens with thoserelationships depending on how wellpeople in the environments are able totake care of that's child's needs andtherefore the crux of Freud's theory isthat personal and social relationshipsthroughout life not just in infancythroughout life in other words what he'stalking about the way you feel aboutyourself the way that you feel aboutother people the way you treat otherpeople the way you treat yourselfaccording to him were founded in veryearly experiences in life based on thischild's need to expend the libidinalenergy and the kind of response thatthey get from the environment veryimportantly remember what was fraud wastrying to explain initiallypsychopathology right let's go back tohis original aim he wanted to find thismind-body connection to find out whythese women that he was seeing werehaving these hysterical conversionswhich is what he eventually called themhysterical because they came from themind conversions because there werephysical symptoms that would generate itfrom the mind rather than the body sowhat he was really out of how to solveis how does how do people becomepathological how do they gain thesepsychic psychiatric illnesses and havesymptoms and he has it all stemming backto wherewhat the needs of the libido as aninfant and what he said many of thepatients that he worked with by the wayas a psychoanalyst they didn't have thishysterical conversion or thephysiological symptoms but rather theyhad what would then called neurosesbehavior patterns that was seen as beingsomehow out of the ordinary so what hewas trying to find out and what he wastheorizing about is how the two infantsearly experience with others in theirenvironment can then lead to thesemassive repressions and then affectrelationships throughout life not justrelationships with other people butrelationships of the child with himselfor herself the way they see themselvesthe way they see other people the waythey interact with other people and he'stying it all back to early childhooddevelopmental any questions about thatI'm not gonna ask is this real is itaccurate or not because that's adifferent question I just want you tounderstand the thinking that goes behindus okay 14 Theory there are five stageswe started with the oral stage roughlybirth roughly I need to just roughtimeframes roughly birth or one yearsoldFreud elegy what he called the firsttrauma the very first travel of thebabies experience does anybody know whatthat is very first the birth traumaaccording to Freud here the infant comesfrom a secure womb right where there isnothing traumatic supposedly going ononce the child is born the child isoverwhelmed with all of these stimulifrom the external environment and thereaction according to Freud is reallyintense fear why is it intense fearbecause the child has no ego to dealwith the external world you're followingthis again in Freud's formulation thechild is born with it impulses arenothing else and no way to mediatereality according to Freud and there aremany therapies there are therapiesthat's actually to evolve from this thatbirth is the first time of the childexperiences and it is then the prototypefor all subsequent traumasit's okay so let's turn to the oralstage let's go let's get to the heart ofthe of the rationality behind us wellthe heart is thinking I'm not so sureit's rational the harder than thinkingabout it can you tell that I'm not a bigadherent to Freud but I think it'simportant that we know exactly what hesaid I think it's really critical thatwe know what a theory was about so thatwe know what strengths and weaknessesare and he got some things right but hegot most things wrong what happens toadd roughly from birth through one whereis the child receiving pleasurethe mother orally through the mouthbecause one of the charts the child'serotic zona or watching his own is themouth when the child gets hungry andneeds to feed and then we did not havebaby formula back then so when childrenfed we were talking about mom's breastshere's where it gets a little bitcomplex but it's real critical tounderstand this the it'd seeks to investlibidinal energy remember what that isthe sexual energy on images that aregoing to bring it satisfaction in thiscase the image is what mom's breastsright I'm sure that in some of yourinternships and your placement you'regonna hear some of these terms they'renot used as much anymore but the act ofinvesting libido energy into the objectthat brings you pleasure is what hecalled cathexis cathexiswhen the itch how does the energy ontothe image not the object itself they'rereally clear but the image of the objectit is connecting that object investingall the energy not necessarily on theobject but the image that the child hasduring we talked about primary processwhat happens the child builds up imagesof the objects that are going to givethem pleasure his following birth theinitial object of cathexis obviously ismom's breasts or today a suitablesubstitute such as the nipple on abottle what is going on with a childaccording to Freud is that the oral zonethe mouth is used to satisfy the needsas the child starts to investigate theworld around him or her and how are theydoing it by collecting on the image thatgives them pleasure and satisfying theirneeds very importantly as children startto grow they start to distinguishbetween me and not be me and not me veryvery young infants according to thisformulation do not know the differencebetween self and other they cannot giveself other differentiate again thisbecomes a very important point for notjust Freud but all of these reformulateerrs after himinitially according to Freud the childbegins to sing with me from not me byregarding pleasure giving objects as aself initially things that do not givepleasure are the non-self in the oralstage there are two stages the receptivesucking and then we have a more activestage which you call the biting stageand what in the real world what we seeinfants doing they stuck and they biteright yes or no so some of this reallyis based on reality it's it's what hesays it's going on the brain of thechild or there not the brain but themind that we need to be pay attention tovery importantly what Freud was sayingis that if during for example thisreceptor stage of sucking swallowingmouthing the breastif the Charles needs are not met here'swhat the pathology comes in theunfulfillment of these needs isexpressed later in their adultpersonality so therefore that's where weget according to Freud some people whohave neurotic over dependency do you seehow this kind of makes sense internallythat if I if I am sucking and I'mdependent and I'm not getting my needsmet what's gonna happen as an adult I'mgoing to express those same kind offrustrations as an adult because I didnot get enough of something as an infantin the biting stage here's the infantgetting a little bit more mature butthey actually have teeth and can biteand the biting stage the childrecognizes the features of out of theoutside objects more clearly and now thechild is able to differentiate me fromnot me and the child starts to realizeit mom who is not me can be both anobject of pleasure and pain because whenmom is not meeting my needs I feel painwhen mom is meeting my needs I feelpleasurewell mom can't be there all the time momcan't be there all the time andtherefore sometimes mom is there givingpleasure in the form of food andsatisfying the oral urges and othertimes the reality is the mom is notthere mom is not gonna feed the baby24/7 or every time he or she cries againcrux of the theory based on this earlystage the infant developed ambivalentfeelings about momambivalent feelings in other words lovehate when mom is giving pleasure theinfant loves mom what happens when momis not giving pleasure come on folkshey okay according to Freud earlyambivalent feelings are expressedabiding again does this make senseinternally that doesn't make sense inthe real world does it make senseinternally I hope sookay and what's more to infants tend tobite mom's breasts people's fingers toysetc etc according to Freud this is notjust the child biting to experiment withbiting what they're expressing is theirfrustration frustration Anthony's notgetting met now let's take a look at thepathology he attributed to this if thechild does not complete progress throughthe stage if their knees are notadequately met they become fixated orstuck at this stage and this showsitself in adult patterns of behavior Ilove this people who have bitingpersonalities people chew each other outfolks this is Freudian theory it soundscomical and in fact there are comedianswho have done skits on this Franken andDavis Al Franken without was a comedianhe's an hour comedian writer andpolitician he and his partner Davis hada very funny skit on 14 stages ofdevelopmentvery importantly in 40 on Theorychildren can become fixated at any stagefixated means there they cannot get pastthat stage and therefore what happenswith the adult personality any guesseswhat what is the show as is adultpersonality it shows us some form ofpsychopathology or neurosis again forthose mostly concerned with neuroses nowhere's the catch-22when people have become when infantswill come fixator children becomefixated it can be the result of eithertoo much needs satisfaction or toolittle need satisfaction think about thecatch-22 for mom how do you know whenyou're giving the child too little ortoo much at each stage the childprogresses according to Freud if he orshe gets enough pleasure to move alongbut does not get too much satisfactionbecause if you get too much satisfactionwhat's gonna happen you're gonna getfixated if you're so totally satisfiedout of that stage you don't not gonnawant to move from that stage if thatmakes senseokay roll this okay back to thePowerPoint so we moved to Freud's nextstage for a second which is the analstage what has happened now the focushas moved from the mouth to the anus tothe yes okay back over to meessentially what are you talking abouthere is potty training essentially whathe's talking about here is pottytraining as young infants infants do nothave the ability to hold in their bowelsand yet to live in a civilized societyyou can't be in diapers all the timeright you're laughing but think aboutthat isn't a civilized society youcannot grow up and stand diapers whereyou cannot hold your bodily functions sothe major task here is control of theback of the bowels however it's not justa physiological task it's also apsychological test a psychosexual chancerather than food the major concern nowobviously the child still needs food butthose needs supposedly have been metmore or less if it's less the todd haspathology if it's more the child haspathology it has to be just right sowe've moved now now here to the childlearning how to hold in the bowels andalso let out when it's necessary veryimportantly during this case the childis having a lot of contact how old arewe talking about now roughly 2 years oldin our society at least that's when wedecide and we've got to think about thisthe reason that we have decided that 2years old is when we have to potty trainhas more to do with the nature ofsociety think about parents who want tobring their two-year-old to somebodyswimming pool now let's look at thisrealistically if you look at othercultures there's nothing magic about theage of 2 that says children have to bepotty trained to - but in this societywith the kind of expectations that wehave and certainly a fourth time he saidthis is the quote-unquote normal timenormal time that this happens in today'ssociety a lot of kids are in daycare anda lot of daycare places don't want kidsand diapers so very importantly what hesays is that it's not just aboutlearning hold until the bowels but it'salso how you develop relationships withpeople while you're doing that here'sgot two sub stages very importantly atthis stage he says this is a very hardstage again this is the theoretical partand he says if the child is toaccomplish bowel and bladder control theego has to resist the is urges becausewhat is the emerge let it out right theit has no reason to hold it in but nowwe have an ego and a two-year-old childthat's growing that says no sometimesyou've got to hold it in someyou gotta hold it in and therefore thelibidinal force it's necessary he calledcounter cathexis at this stage folksthis is not gonna be on the exam I wantyou to understand the rationale therationale thought the rationality therationale behind the theory in otherwords the air just wants pleasurepleasure pleasure and for an infant whatis a pleasurable to do is to let it outand it takes a lot of training for thechild to learn when to hold it in andwhen to let it go and therefore in the14 model the child had to developsomething calledcounter to Texas because one of thechalk affected on they have the imagesand things are given pleasure and whatcould some pleasure of letting it outthere for to not let it out the it hasto borrow energy from the ego to learnhow to hold it in is this becoming asclear as mud get very importantlycathexis letting it out as pleasurableholding it in is not and therefore it'sgot to be handled responsibly by theadults from the child's life if it's nothandled responsibly the charge is goingto repress the conflict and the childwill become possibly compulsively cleanChristian social situations andinteractions frequent use of cursingthat's in the early stages and the laterstages when the child learns how to holdit in the child can start hoardingthings the adult can start hoardingthings you don't see how thesepathologies relate to deliberately anddirectly to the developmental tasks whatit said was going onokay next stage is the phallic stageback to the PowerPoint for just a minutethe phallic stage this is probably oneof the most important stages in Freud'stheory and I'm going to talk you throughthis roughly where do we get the phallicstage what age roughly three to fiveyears old so by the ends of the phallicstage what is starting to develop thesuper-ego you're following this okaythis is really the heart and soul ofFreudian theory but all of it is theheart the soul this is a very importantstage now the zone the erogenous zonehas moved from the mouth from the anusto where to the genitals and here he'stalking about real sexual pleasure inhis mind's so the child and two childrenfondle their sex parts all the time theydon't know any better they don't knowthat it's not allowed until they theyhave incorporated the super-ego rightaccording to Freud what the child doesis the child tends to associate thefondling of the genitals with the objectof pleasure who in this point is whatmom right we'll think about the realitywho is taking care of the baby's needsprimarily its momlet's start with this Freud said thathumans are inherently bisexual let'sstart with that he did not think thatthat sexual orientation was somethingthat was part of what we what we inheritwith the in he said we could go eitherway what did it keeps us from beinghomosexual or continue to be bisexual iswhat the socialization of society thatsays heterosexuality is the normso therefore this isn't open during thephallic stage the cathexis from mom nowtakes on genital properties you'refollowing that the cathexis for mominitially it was the mouth and mom'sbreastsnow it takes on general qualities solittle boys masturbate and what do theyfeel they feel pleasure that's the it'ssaying gimme gimme gimme right the childthen according to Freud pairs thispleasure with whom with mom not just mombut the image of mom is everybody clearabout that that primary process is theimages and according to Freud what'shappened with trusted developers inoedipal complex in that dad becomes arival for mom's attention and affectionhowever since the child is bisexualhe also was it's a boy child acts like alittle girl and has affection for deadand jealousy for mom so you develop thisambivalent feelings towards both sets ofparents and these double set ofattitudes become what he called theOedipus complex as the child grows olderthey learn the sex differences andcrocks of grocery that boys come toconclude the girls once had a penis andthat it was taken away from them aspunishment you're laughing you'relaughing why are you laughing because itdoesn't reflect the real world right itdoesn't reflect the real worldhe called this constriction anxietycastration anxiety and therefore the boybecomes afraid of several things losingsad love and affection and also oflosing his penis very importantly here'swhere the super-ego starts to come in atthe end of the stage what's happeningthe child then has to identify with jabthe boy has to identify dad and developwhat equals a reaction formation toalleviate the negative feelings aboutdad because so far the child is feelingvery conflictual about both mom and dadright now what happens for this processit can't stay in the conscious mind itbecomes everybody repressed okay girlshowever Freud saw as being inferior whydo you see them as being inferiorbecause they do not have castrationcomplex they know from the beginningthat they never had one of those righthowever girls also first connect on momgirls as well are also bisexual anddeveloped two sets of attitudes towardsmom and dad however in Freudian theorywhen the girl discovers she has no penisshe starts to feel inferior because lotsof reality little boys and girls saydoctor at the stage yes you show meyours and I'll show you minevery commonly according to Freud becauseunlike boys who have castration complexwas for which by the way castrationcomplex and his theory forces thedevelopment of the super-ego forces thebetter development of the ego you'refollowing this they have to get overthat castration complex and thereforetheir ego becomes more and more healthyand they become more on the individuatedgirls however don't have a castrationprop don't have a castration complex andwhen they've discovered they have nopenis they start to feel inferior doesit sound like the real world folks nobut it's the real world of Freudiantheory and what happens is that this canlead to masculine behavior or sexualinhibition as an adult more commonlygirls come to resent their mom who hadthe same exact deficits that they do andtherefore it intensifies theirattachment to their dad and they startto see Mama's arrival I love this partaccording to Freud the way that girlscompensate for this need is that theyhave an unconscious wish to have dad'sbaby remember this is a very sexuallybased three very importantly accordingto Freud because girls do not have asuper-ego do not have do not have theanxiety that caused them to have astronger super-ego girls inherentlybecause of their biology have a weakersuper-ego so they are never quite thesame whole people and thereforeaccording to Freud women girls have aproblem in sublimating that's turningtheir nasty and impulses into positiveactions and they stay narcissisticlevain and bitter about their genitalsthus according to him women become moreneurotic do you start to understand buthis logic not logic his logic in this okwhat I'd like you to do is a couple ofcartoons that my friend Jim Daniel dofor me these some of these are fairlyfamous cartoons but he drew his ownversion of them can you focus in on thisok can you all read that this one saysmommy said that you got one of those butwe got the brains there's another cuteversion of it nope never had one what doyou ask and this is probably the mostfamous one so that explains ourdifferences in pay everybody found a lotto give this series so far ok so do youunderstand how how important this stagethe phallic stage and the oedipalcomplex are not just informing howpeople feel about themselves in fraud intheory but how they developrelationships with others and againthat's why I saw women as being soinferior because he saw them as beingvery narcissistic because they did nothave a penis and therefore felt inferiordue to that ok let's go to the nextstage which he called back to thePowerPoint for a minute the latencystage so let's let's take a look atwhat's going on here back over to me thedominant zone at the latency stageroughly ages 4 or 5 to puberty it's avery big stage right time was thedominant zone of gratification is stillthe genitals however it is not displayedin behavior because what's happening thechild is busy repressing all of thosesexual urges towards mom and dad you'refollowing thisthey're trying to resolve this ediblecomplex that arose afore that stage andwhat Ford says that what sometimesarises here or what always arises thisrepression leads to what he calledinfantile amnesia anybody know whatinfant television is it is somethingthat is real by the wayit's a real phenomenon why why ithappens is probably different than whatFord said as we get older we tend tolose most of our memories of childhoodagain as we get older we can't we'lllose most of our memories of childhoodchildren we'll talk about this later onof course children actually have verygood memories children tend to be ableto tell you what they've done they mightnot have the vocabulary to tell youeverything but children have very goodmemories for things that they've doneand seen however one of the things thatdoes happen as we get older is that wetend to lose most of our childhoodmemories we do not have memories fromwhen we were infants why is that we donot have memories a lot of very concretememories about most of our childhood whyis that according to Freud is we are sobusy having to deal with the oedipalcomplex the oedipal complex andtherefore because we know that we're notsuppose have sexual urges towards momand dad that we have to repress all ofthese urges and that's what causes theinfantile amnesia and Freudian theorynow a symptom tell em Nisha a realphenomenon Beatriz absolutely yes butprobably not I think I could say becausethey're probably not for the reasonsthat he said so what do we still seechildren doing at this stage folkstypically what are children four or fivedo they play with same sex friends youtalk to a boy about maybe you didn'thave a girlfriend somedayoh no yuck right they're not interestedin the opposite sexthey're playing with same sex friendsand what's happening according to Freudis that the super-ego is gainingstrengthwhat they're doing by playing withsame-sex friends they're trying tocontrol and for nyan theory their sexualthoughts towards mom and dad veryimportantly playing by the rules here isvery very important and now we have afully developed or developing super-egoand what happens is that children playgames that play activities and it's veryimportant in terms of conformity whatchildren are learning during the stageshas to conform not just to mommy anddaddy's rules put through the logicrules of society not surprisingly ifchildren get fixated here they haveproblems later on with sexualrelationships with the opposite sex orthey might perform sexual activities ina very aggressive manner if they becomefixated right fixated means gettingstuck at a stage what if children getstuck because they got too much or toolittle need satisfaction finally for itsfinal stage the PowerPoint for just asecond which he called the genital stageget back over to me this is what hecalled the mature genital periodremember from the third stage oneverything is still concentrated in thegenitals the phallic stage is thegenitals the latency states and theGenesis the genitals and this is themature genital chance age what is goingon with teenagers roughly during pubertyis this that's where the stage beginsroughly puberty to adulthood what isgoing on biologically with with childrenmassive physical changes massivehormonal changes right so we see thephysiological changes that areassociated with puberty and notsurprisingly he killed me at this stageturn their attention to the opposite sexwhether we want them to or notclearly girls do this more quickly thanboys because girls simply maturesocially quicker than boys do butluckily for us boys do catch up most ofthem do what happens at this stageaccording to Freud the mature the matureresponsible this is copulation yeshowever here we are with children of 14and 15 and 16 and what what's happeningto those urges to copulate they'regetting frustrated by the society thatsays no you're too young right soSociety erect barriers to them gettingthose needs fulfilled in this finalstage according to Freud society's rulesmake adolescents sublimate as a defensemechanism by sublimating you repress theit urges and what comes out and yourbehavior is pro-social activities inother words what are you doing withthose sexual urges you're repressingthem back down to the deep unconsciousyou're following that and what has tohappen is they've got to stay represseduntil you're old enough to have sexright or until you're old enough forsociety to say that you can have sex inin marriage of course and what happensis that and typically once you seechildren doing at this age they getinvolved in Scouting they get involvedin in peer groups right they getinvolved in lots of pro-social kinds ofthings and they're in schoolthey become involved in artisticactivities philanthropic activities andthose are good coping mechanisms forthis stage very importantly for Freud asthe child turns the attention away fromsame-sex friends toward other senseother other sects in other words inearly adulthood when you're now oldenough to get married and have sex thisis when the oedipal complex becomesresolved is this making sense to you notin the real world but making sense toyou in terms of better understandingFreudian theory any questions about thatbecause I want to move on and talk aboutsome of the 40 and reformulate errs andtalk about the current controversy noquestionsthis is surprisingokay let's go back to the PowerPoint asI said we're not gonna be able to covereverybody in the lectures but you dohave all of the reformulate errs yeahmost of the reform you laters and andpeople who have changes theories I wantto just point out really quickly twotheorists who are feminists who reallyrevised Freudian thought and I'm notgonna have time to get into a lot oftheir theory but I want to show you whatfeminists before feminists withformulations of Freud look like Karenhorney psychoanalyst said penis envy ifit exists exists because not the girlsare jealous of boys penises but they'rejealous of the status that is associatedwith having a penis because she saidlet's look at the reality society valuesmen more than women they did in her timeperiod and do they still yesunfortunately not to the same extent butcertainly what she also said she came upwith her own reformulation that shecalled woman B and she said if women areenvious of men's penises it's because ofthe status but she said men who arereally driven to be successful do sobecause they don't have the ability toprocreate and therefore they are enviousof the fact that women can that'sturning it on his head yes well that'simportant but the Freud thought thatwomen were inferior Freud thought thewomen he first of all he said openlythat he didn't understand women but hethought that they were inferior she alsocame up her work is fascinating by theway she came up with her own theory ofneuroses in which he had ten differentpatterns of neurotic needs that had todo with how people relate to each othershe very strongly emphasized culturaland social differences she came up withthe theory of the real self and theideal self but again this is areformulation of Freud so it is stillvery Freudian based and it's still basedon trying to explain how people becomeneurotichowever unlike Freud's negative orpessimistic view of people particularlyof womenshe really shared Abraham Maslow's viewthat people really strive forself-actualizationsome higher sense of self another one ofthe reformulate errs more recently morecurrently as Nancy Chadha roomNancy chowder Oh was very interestingboth the psychoanalyst and a sociologistboth the psychoanalyst and a sociologistand she was really interested in herwork in the psychological reasons thatwomen desire motherhood clearly we knowthat there are biological reasons yesbut she was interested more in thepsychological reasons so in her attemptsto explain that she came up with her owntheory that says again this is puttingFreud turning port around entirely cuzFreud said that woman's development wasproblematic and conflictual yes why wasa conflictual because they never got thecastration complex because they didn'thave a penis and therefore women developnot as did well developed super egosshe turned 40 and theory on its head andsaid wait a minuteit's not female development it'sconflictual it's male development andfemale development is fine and importantin order to have women want to pre-opprocreate everyone following this notjust biologically but whypsychologically woman with women want toand folks let's put this in contextprocreation was very very necessary forperpetuation of the species soessentially which is was asking and thisis much of this theory not hers but muchtheory was written before we had birthcontrol now we can control the timing inwhich we have children beforeprocreation was just naturally a part oflife we didn't have effective birthcontrol we had condoms but peoplesometimes use them sometimes didn'tsometimes they broke the procreation wasa very important part of life sotherefore she was trying to explain whatwas a psychological phenomenon that wentinto women wanting to appropriate backto the PowerPointand here's a reformulation she said thatinfants experience a primary onenesswith mother let's think about that ifit's cannot self other differentiaterightshe's right with Freud on that she'sright there with Freud and says theycan't self differentiate and thereforewhat they experience is being one withtheir mom as they begin to differentiateitself from other she says girls andboys have different experiences girlsexperience femaleness they are very muchlike mom they develop a strong bond tomom cuz MOT they are female and moms arefemale and guess what moms do in returndevelop a strong bond to the femalechild cuz the female child is more likeher than not like her boys however if Istart to individuate and differentiateknow that they're not like mom andtherefore they experience somethingcalled being not female therefore boyshave a much more conflictual and hardertime in her formulation because ratherthan becoming closer to mom andidentifying with mom they must formlooser attachments and in herformulation this is exactly how comewomen in their strong attachments to momwant to be more like mom and thereforewant to procreate on a psychologicallevel not just a biological level doesthat make sense do you see how we cantake these same concepts that we can'tmeasure and just turn them upside downokay in the last part of the class Iwant to talk about the most currentcontroversy and that has to do with ohthe other thing with Charo said by theway is that acceptance of the domesticideal of women having children is trulythe foundation of women's oppressionbecause if you take a look back to whatwe expect women to do and what men to dowe give women very narrowly constrictedroles of being wives and mothers andthat according to Charo is what leads totheir oppression so she really waslooking at the bigger picture as wellokay here's what I call Freud is dead oris he or is he I have a an article up onweb CT with a link I've put the actualarticle up there and a link and I'lltalk a little bit about this work for TMtheory had just about died out by the1970s and 80s you can come back over tome for tea in theory I just about diedout by the 70s and 80s and all of asudden Freudian Theory became revivedwith the work of Jeffrey Masson andAlice Miller the article that I put upthere is an article about JefferyMadison's controversy about theseduction theory let me talk about theseduction theory in some of his earlywritings in early writings Freudbelieved that children were actuallybeing abused sexually abused by by theirparents by adults and what to this abusebecause it gets repressed remember alltraumas get repressed from Freudiantheory what happens to them as adultscome on folksyes T is the they develop neurosesdevelop neuroses are all the kinds ofpathologies right so he was seeingclients that will come to him and he wasconvinced that the root of theirproblems that was something clearly thathappened in childhood and they couldthey said they had no memory of beingsexually abused and he used all kinds ofmethods including hypnosis and otherkinds of relaxation techniques to getpeople to think about their abuse andsure enough when pressed and pressuredliterally pressured these women wouldeventually come up with details of abuseso that was his first hypothesis thewomen were truly being abused thechildren not just women lookpreponderance women later on he changedhis theory and it came to say that theyare they are not experience real abusethey are experiencing fantasies in otherwords they are fantasizing about beingabused by about having sex with theirparents is this very consistent withthis theory right fantasizing abouthaving sex with parents if you take alook at his original works and somepeople point to this fantasy if he votedwith PHA NT asi ASI e and he was talkingabout an unconscious process somehowthat became known as a conscious processfantasizing mass and then came along andsaid okay wait a minute let's look athis early work and Masson decided and Ireally want you to read this you cannotunderstand Freud without understandingthe context of his medical practice ofthe psychoanalytic practice he was alsodoing a lot of surgery on people andI've given you that article to read anda lot of what we know about Freud is notonly in his writings but also in letterscorrespondence he had with otheranalysts and it's a fascinating readabout his about his seduction theoryMasen came along he was in charge of theFreud archives at the time and he camealong and he took a look at all ofFreud's writing and hewait a minute Freud gave up hisseduction theory in other words thechildren were really being abusedbecause of pressure from his peers thatwas masses take on it and right aboutthis time let's think about this we didnot have laws against child abuse orchild sexual abuse until the 1970s wedidn't talk about child sexual abuse soin the name of feminism what was revivedhere in the name feminism by Masson andother feminist scholars they were sayingwait a minute let's take a look Ford wasright the first timeFreud was right the first time when hesaid the children are truly beingmolested by their parents and thereforewe came up with these theories ofrepressed memory right back to Freud andrepression what we developed then was aculture in which therapists were beingtaught that the root of all evil theroot of all of women's problems some men- primarily women is that they haverepressed memories of childhood sexualabuse even they couldn't tell you aboutif they don't remember it the same waythat forth early clients couldn't tellhim about it couldn't give him detailsbut when given enough therapy they cameup with it and what evolved essentiallywas a whole culture in which women wouldgo to therapy with what I would callrelatively mundane problems and come outbelieving in sexual abuse that neveroccurred or most likely never occurredwomen who who had been abused we're toldby their therapists the abuse do youremember is not important it's the abuseyou don't remember that's keeping yousick so back to the next slide and wecould talk more about thisthere were several different kinds oftraumas that have come to be writtenabout to help understand massiverepression because the question comes uphow can people massively repress thingshow can you be abused for years andyears and years and not remember thatand some of these theories came up withexplanations for that the currentscientific consensus and I'm gonna leavethis on the PowerPoint which is gonna beon web CT after 50 years of researchtwelve hundred and twenty studies morethan fourteen thousand people withdocumented experiences of trauma thereis no evidence of repressed memory doesthat surprise youit doesn't most people would say ofcourse it surprises me because webelieve so strongly in repression whatwe found through research and this werecalled scientific consensus is that themost common ways that people forget isnormal forgetting mechanisms sometimesinfantile amnesia we simply can'tremember things that have happened to usintoxication or brain injury in a recentcourt brief a statement was made thatdecades of research and scientificdebate have clarified over and over thatthe notion of traumatic events beingsomehow repressed and later accuratelyjust and accurately recovered is one ofthe most pernicious bits of folklore toever infect psychology and psychiatrythat said we do have a consensus theprofessional consensus by the way isvery conflictual because there was asmall group of people who believed therepression and a larger group of peoplewho now say this is absolutely bogushere's what we do know about childsexual abuse it is harmful and prevalentso we're not denying that child abusedoes occur again child sexual abuse isvery harmful and very prevalent satanicritual abuse is rare most people whowere abusedremember all or part of what happenedand adults with continuous memories aremore likely to have accurate memoriesfinally although it is rare some traumascan beforgotten and legit remembered you donot have to repress a tablet memoriesfrom infancy are highly unreliable andfinally false or pseudo memories can becreated and we can talk more about thisok any questions we have a minute and 24seconds leftokay well we'll handle questions in thesecond part of class thank you all\""

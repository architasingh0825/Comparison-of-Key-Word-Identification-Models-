stuff.putting in detail section.and then again you can take it you can divide it up enough enough.how to make sperm.process for ovulation process.larger.postal system.internal environment.what is Papo.you still gets me and see what happens when.going to medical school and in other professional School.?.but you don't understand understand how it works.let's.all the different system.our structure in frayser Boulevard it also protectors.material.make new things already you come in here with no right.all right it's a long way right so we need to deal with this.your body's job is to try to maintain.you think about your body.the way that we do this principle or concept.find a different way of mass balance for the law of mass action will be used in chemistry.terrible Mall.can your body have to have on that play 40 years ago.okay.Play Back in the pantry.constant ear.it's so easy Wonder think of okay things things on secreting or exporting really.there are things that I'm losing.make something new.they making something new I've also lost something that I already have.it's so those are part of the chemical balances everybody have to deal with.very often we have to remember this as well.so our bodies deals with this Nest balance all the time not just in the tablet.this in many different areas.this is where we could start everything go down to the cellular level.has been divided into area.we have.how about a sweet and I don't like a dorm room suite.right example we have compartmentalization.would you agree.AutoZone.all right space has been divided all.compartment you need from each other is that barrier.it just this interstitial in basically.and that means little compartment in the fluid that move stuff around the bottom.exchanges between the blood plasma and.I just need to have a mechanism.problem that we have some when you start talking about it.always something going on.makeup.interstitial space.measure how much.virturaf chemical equilibrium.refer to as a discipline.Asus osmotically.supposed to be the plasma this is.and you can see for example.inside the cell..well we have an osmotic every single amount of stuff.what that means is that if you look at the body and count number of causes.but that's not internalized electrical.another word for moving because of where they're located.because we can take advantage of this is energy.equilibrium and it is a dynamic steady-state me.that's what that happened when that happens we're starting to affect your equilibrium.Shuffle backwards.regard to donate.you guys are technically Junior so you've already taken vile you one of my album to.you already understand.figure out what's going on.we have a plasma membrane and a plasma membrane.when you were traveling along Route.this is SeaWorld night Shannon.write up next.membrane.physical isolation.just like you have a wall at your house regulate.right out of the doorway.coworx.decide decide based on how that platinum ring works.forget your part of that my remembering right so you can explore the environment around.here I mean like an artifact machine imagines.I need to tell her using the 13 to communicate.hotel right beside remembering.April service Anna basolateral.3:45.a bunch of lipids.are water heating some water heated water expire.listen.a bilayer excluded from the water.when you look at the number of Plaza.what's going on with that sell still have lots of fun.so far all the time.refresh.what you're seeing here you can see here has a two fatty acid Tails this.hydrophobic.and so when you get a whole bunch of these what they do they do a random stuff.if you're this phospholipid around very rarely will you see.alright Spotify..chillers what Sound hearing at 4.but again I'm not going to ask you to know what the structural will let's talk.alright.I do consider.double fatty acids.and then the spa scene.it's always.but you can see if you're in the phosphate group and then there's that.typically.basically.accumulate.least.they're very common flipping this direction..cholesterol.hydrophobic.put myself into a plasma membrane.cholesterol is in the plasma membrane.straight or they can be slightly.figuration.disconfirmation.trans fatty acid tails in basically from getting too stiff.at what temperature's do most molecule stop moving.right and I cool down too fat.butter for the fridge.right.separate.variety.talking about them breaking into major classes.Marshalls.a protein is.till we all graduate.you stopped because.incredibly difficult word know and understand numbers and hashtag.Rosen Inn.who are going to be going on tonight.look at it.Volkswagen advertising.German words.integral proteins are integrated into the plasma membrane.sometimes we have her keys integrated into.integrated through but they'll be anchored down here with son.some proteins and move around on Pleasant membrane Cinemark anchored to Pleasantburg.protein.interact.extra.able to use as a way to communicate.material.r-bar.all right it was using infusion mode.replying to do cell.the pressure.so another words I'm talking to find out what's going on.friends that are.General category.halfway through it.concentrate.aquaporin this is a water for.transport molecules.to the other side so if you're picking something up.cannot open driver.Airport.you're not open to either side and it won't open.so that would be bound up the molecule.remember.concentration.workday brakes.is there moving things against the gradient where these are typically moving down the brakes.we're going to see here in just a moment which is a active form where my planets move something down the gravy but I'm use.downward gradient.your best friend in the short while.that's 1000 times.remembering this is our Jeep.activate speaker.so because it's integrated or associated with that memory.intercellular.play Mystikal case-control insulin pathway.sub membrane cytoskeletal elements.this would be.Credit Union.all the parts of the.anchoring what we do.CFMOTO co-anchoring Mustang Corsa.a bunch of lipids and three different types of angles.cholesterol.and these are carbohydrates.protein for women.beautiful Connecticut.fine marker.so it really is specific to the individual.glycoprotein.any questions so far just kind of Navigator.something out.no question.understand all right.or you probably remember to know.gradient that drives the movement of fluid I Want You to Breathe In For a Moment.what's the biggest.when I have gas.what's the primary.the respiratory system is a really easy way.alright it's hailing stuff at my body want.plasma is remember.there's a lot of stuff.a couple of those things are all moving in particular direction and are moving down for.removing specific things are up and down their concentration.4.Apartments.if a substance cannot pass through the membrane.permeability.alright looking at this molecule what type of molecule is it.important.something is permeable.lyrics to staying alive.that Shelby.around through the water.impermeable.highly soluble.so we're going to get with example.turn down the radio..have those cars.time moving through plasma membrane.remember this also.unless you need something if it's passes for.movement.ATP Leonard.so there are different types of transport necklaces.transport and secondary.transport diffusion.until May.story plot.I don't care.Byron for example.equilibrium.environment.are you done.permeable membrane.so there is no concentration concentration.directions.concentration never moving in the opposite direction and we're actually moving to.which is the direction I'm going.keep moving in all directions.directions.equilibrium.higher temperatures.kinetic energy.refer to the energy stored in the molecule so they're moving more frequently.score.smaller moves faster.has barrier.these are in the state some facts.tomorrow.marble baseball.you can see here you're looking at a property in the mall so the drunk working at the property.membrane.so.find the door door.distance.you know.alright.they want to move down that.with that with the keyboard.what was keeping it over there is still attracting an ion back in the directions.alternative directions.basically talking about the movement.many things can pass through no problem always 120 extra.so we're going to see.real Snapchat.so here's our ion when the channel is closed.all of them have this door gate.Tommy's channels.Easter always.cornerbacks.so we have open Channel that's always open.something you do that.concentration.this is where.refreshment modalities.mobile.different type of saying the mode.example.I like that.idea.so if you are a nasty Channel.if you are a cation channel of a bearing type.WhatsApp.basically you select what degree to find to you once you bind is this your open one side.open to the external environment is fine right.confirmation I'm not open to either.12.another word.or dog or cat or whatever you want.that's kind of what's going on here.can you go back to the confirmation.what are using carry me to transport the whole bunch of characteristics.so if your glucose carrier.specificity is one factor that.is there any more than one thing.A-1 Mulch.increase number of X can't exceed that bastard right.number of muscles.blindsight.transport this deals with using energy.the first time actually required energy to be directly use this is primary active transport so you actually have an 80th.release the energy energy causes confirmation change to move materials.directions to 11.water.energy trying to move into your directions so whatever.how long until you're in the process of them move something into directions.uphill.comment.attracted.outside gradient.accident because of confirmation.sodium.potassium and I'm building up concentration and direction that it doesn't want to go.but has no choice because.he can't go because it's more.elaborate.concentration gradient.positive confirmation.or should be.so this one doesn't.imbalanced equilibrium.memorize everything.directions.so using the same direction directions.appreciated.is similar.secondary active.in the same directions Sim alright so basically what we're doing is an exchange account.B2 carpet ball.body in ourselves work that they do.able to maintain.a great day guys.\n",

down to.organism.Oregon, what\\'s there.wow you know what I\\'m going to do is like a memorize a whole bunch of stuff.putting in detail section.and then again you can take it you can divide it up enough enough.how to make sperm.process for ovulation process.larger.postal system.internal environment.what is Papo.you still gets me and see what happens when.going to medical school and in other professional School.?.but you don\\'t understand understand how it works.let\\'s.all the different system.our structure in frayser Boulevard it also protectors.material.make new things already you come in here with no right.all right it\\'s a long way right so we need to deal with this.your body\\'s job is to try to maintain.you think about your body.the way that we do this principle or concept.find a different way of mass balance for the law of mass action will be used in chemistry.terrible Mall.can your body have to have on that play 40 years ago.okay.Play Back in the pantry.constant ear.it\\'s so easy Wonder think of okay things things on secreting or exporting really.there are things that I\\'m losing.make something new.they making something new I\\'ve also lost something that I already have.it\\'s so those are part of the chemical balances everybody have to deal with.very often we have to remember this as well.so our bodies deals with this Nest balance all the time not just in the tablet.this in many different areas.this is where we could start everything go down to the cellular level.has been divided into area.we have.how about a sweet and I don\\'t like a dorm room suite.right example we have compartmentalization.would you agree.AutoZone.all right space has been divided all.compartment you need from each other is that barrier.it just this interstitial in basically.and that means little compartment in the fluid that move stuff around the bottom.exchanges between the blood plasma and.I just need to have a mechanism.problem that we have some when you start talking about it.always something going on.makeup.interstitial space.measure how much.virturaf chemical equilibrium.refer to as a discipline.Asus osmotically.supposed to be the plasma this is.and you can see for example.inside the cell..well we have an osmotic every single amount of stuff.what that means is that if you look at the body and count number of causes.but that\\'s not internalized electrical.another word for moving because of where they\\'re located.because we can take advantage of this is energy.equilibrium and it is a dynamic steady-state me.that\\'s what that happened when that happens we\\'re starting to affect your equilibrium.Shuffle backwards.regard to donate.you guys are technically Junior so you\\'ve already taken vile you one of my album to.you already understand.figure out what\\'s going on.we have a plasma membrane and a plasma membrane.when you were traveling along Route.this is SeaWorld night Shannon.write up next.membrane.physical isolation.just like you have a wall at your house regulate.right out of the doorway.coworx.decide decide based on how that platinum ring works.forget your part of that my remembering right so you can explore the environment around.here I mean like an artifact machine imagines.I need to tell her using the 13 to communicate.hotel right beside remembering.April service Anna basolateral.3:45.a bunch of lipids.are water heating some water heated water expire.listen.a bilayer excluded from the water.when you look at the number of Plaza.what\\'s going on with that sell still have lots of fun.so far all the time.refresh.what you\\'re seeing here you can see here has a two fatty acid Tails this.hydrophobic.and so when you get a whole bunch of these what they do they do a random stuff.if you\\'re this phospholipid around very rarely will you see.alright Spotify..chillers what Sound hearing at 4.but again I\\'m not going to ask you to know what the structural will let\\'s talk.alright.I do consider.double fatty acids.and then the spa scene.it\\'s always.but you can see if you\\'re in the phosphate group and then there\\'s that.typically.basically.accumulate.least.they\\'re very common flipping this direction..cholesterol.hydrophobic.put myself into a plasma membrane.cholesterol is in the plasma membrane.straight or they can be slightly.figuration.disconfirmation.trans fatty acid tails in basically from getting too stiff.at what temperature\\'s do most molecule stop moving.right and I cool down too fat.butter for the fridge.right.separate.variety.talking about them breaking into major classes.Marshalls.a protein is.till we all graduate.you stopped because.incredibly difficult word know and understand numbers and hashtag.Rosen Inn.who are going to be going on tonight.look at it.Volkswagen advertising.German words.integral proteins are integrated into the plasma membrane.sometimes we have her keys integrated into.integrated through but they\\'ll be anchored down here with son.some proteins and move around on Pleasant membrane Cinemark anchored to Pleasantburg.protein.interact.extra.able to use as a way to communicate.material.r-bar.all right it was using infusion mode.replying to do cell.the pressure.so another words I\\'m talking to find out what\\'s going on.friends that are.General category.halfway through it.concentrate.aquaporin this is a water for.transport molecules.to the other side so if you\\'re picking something up.cannot open driver.Airport.you\\'re not open to either side and it won\\'t open.so that would be bound up the molecule.remember.concentration.workday brakes.is there moving things against the gradient where these are typically moving down the brakes.we\\'re going to see here in just a moment which is a active form where my planets move something down the gravy but I\\'m use.downward gradient.your best friend in the short while.that\\'s 1000 times.remembering this is our Jeep.activate speaker.so because it\\'s integrated or associated with that memory.intercellular.play Mystikal case-control insulin pathway.sub membrane cytoskeletal elements.this would be.Credit Union.all the parts of the.anchoring what we do.CFMOTO co-anchoring Mustang Corsa.a bunch of lipids and three different types of angles.cholesterol.and these are carbohydrates.protein for women.beautiful Connecticut.fine marker.so it really is specific to the individual.glycoprotein.any questions so far just kind of Navigator.something out.no question.understand all right.or you probably remember to know.gradient that drives the movement of fluid I Want You to Breathe In For a Moment.what\\'s the biggest.when I have gas.what\\'s the primary.the respiratory system is a really easy way.alright it\\'s hailing stuff at my body want.plasma is remember.there\\'s a lot of stuff.a couple of those things are all moving in particular direction and are moving down for.removing specific things are up and down their concentration.4.Apartments.if a substance cannot pass through the membrane.permeability.alright looking at this molecule what type of molecule is it.important.something is permeable.lyrics to staying alive.that Shelby.around through the water.impermeable.highly soluble.so we\\'re going to get with example.turn down the radio..have those cars.time moving through plasma membrane.remember this also.unless you need something if it\\'s passes for.movement.ATP Leonard.so there are different types of transport necklaces.transport and secondary.transport diffusion.until May.story plot.I don\\'t care.Byron for example.equilibrium.environment.are you done.permeable membrane.so there is no concentration concentration.directions.concentration never moving in the opposite direction and we\\'re actually moving to.which is the direction I\\'m going.keep moving in all directions.directions.equilibrium.higher temperatures.kinetic energy.refer to the energy stored in the molecule so they\\'re moving more frequently.score.smaller moves faster.has barrier.these are in the state some facts.tomorrow.marble baseball.you can see here you\\'re looking at a property in the mall so the drunk working at the property.membrane.so.find the door door.distance.you know.alright.they want to move down that.with that with the keyboard.what was keeping it over there is still attracting an ion back in the directions.alternative directions.basically talking about the movement.many things can pass through no problem always 120 extra.so we\\'re going to see.real Snapchat.so here\\'s our ion when the channel is closed.all of them have this door gate.Tommy\\'s channels.Easter always.cornerbacks.so we have open Channel that\\'s always open.something you do that.concentration.this is where.refreshment modalities.mobile.different type of saying the mode.example.I like that.idea.so if you are a nasty Channel.if you are a cation channel of a bearing type.WhatsApp.basically you select what degree to find to you once you bind is this your open one side.open to the external environment is fine right.confirmation I\\'m not open to either.12.another word.or dog or cat or whatever you want.that\\'s kind of what\\'s going on here.can you go back to the confirmation.what are using carry me to transport the whole bunch of characteristics.so if your glucose carrier.specificity is one factor that.is there any more than one thing.A-1 Mulch.increase number of X can\\'t exceed that bastard right.number of muscles.blindsight.transport this deals with using energy.the first time actually required energy to be directly use this is primary active transport so you actually have an 80th.release the energy energy causes confirmation change to move materials.directions to 11.water.energy trying to move into your directions so whatever.how long until you\\'re in the process of them move something into directions.uphill.comment.attracted.outside gradient.accident because of confirmation.sodium.potassium and I\\'m building up concentration and direction that it doesn\\'t want to go.but has no choice because.he can\\'t go because it\\'s more.elaborate.concentration gradient.positive confirmation.or should be.so this one doesn\\'t.imbalanced equilibrium.memorize everything.directions.so using the same direction directions.appreciated.is similar.secondary active.in the same directions Sim alright so basically what we\\'re doing is an exchange account.B2 carpet ball.body in ourselves work that they do.able to maintain.a great day guys.\\n'"
